Therefore only cold chain requirements, vaccination commodities (syringes, vials, and alcohol prep pads), and medical waste disposal were included. This study does not quantify impacts associated with the production of vaccines themselves nor their distribution/transport (aside from cold chain logistics).","159","Verification requested","",""
