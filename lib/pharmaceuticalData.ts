    abstract: "Purpose: To introduce a scalable methodology for assessing the economic and environmental impacts of reusable versus single-use devices, with a novel approach of processing reusable devices through low-temperature sterilization (LTS) (STERRAD®). Methods: The economic analysis used micro-costing techniques while carbon footprint was calculated with two different methods: \"UO Sté method\" derived from Deschavannes et al. (2021) and an ISO 14040/14044 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the sterilization of the reusable device performed with OPENLCA v2.4.0 software and ELCD v3.2 free database. The uncertainty analysis was performed with a Monte Carlo analysis. These methods were applied to a case study from cystoscopes procedures performed (2023). Results: Our LCA study indicates an annual reduction of 582.4 kg CO2 equivalent (−14.5%) in favor of reusable devices. Regarding the economic impact, more specific to our case study, the findings suggest an annual cost savings of €108,484, (−29%). It is important to note that the analysis is based on an \"in-house\" LCA model. Additionally, this study provides an objective comparison without considering logistical challenges, personnel requirements, or implementation costs of reusable devices. It does not substitute the collaborative medical and paramedical judgment of a urology department. Conclusions: LTS of reusable cystoscopes seems to have a significant decrease of the environmental footprint and economic impact.",

    abstract: "Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of single-use and reusable video laryngoscopes. Methods: We performed life-cycle assessments of video laryngoscopes at a tertiary-care academic center: single-use Ambu aScope 4 RhinoLaryngo Slim (Ambu Inc., Columbia, MD), single-use Video Rhino-Laryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and reusable Storz Video Rhinolaryngoscope 1101HD. We collected data regarding lifecycle, manual reprocessing, and waste disposal at our institution. The lifetime carbon footprint of each device was calculated and included emissions related to manufacturing, transportation, sterilization, repair, and disposal. We then assessed carbon footprint of each device per procedure. Results: The total estimated carbon footprint per procedure for single-use Ambu and Storz laryngoscopes is 7.46 and 5.49 kg CO2, respectively. The mass of solid waste of single-use laryngoscopes and packaging contribute to carbon emissions of 0.173 and 0.40 kg CO2 for Ambu and Storz laryngoscopes, respectively. Reusable laryngoscopes are estimated to have a carbon footprint of 0.1137 kg CO2 per procedure at our institution. The greatest contributions to carbon footprint during reusable laryngoscope manual reprocessing include personal protective equipment solid waste and electrical energy (0.0859 and 0.016 kg CO2, respectively). The carbon footprint of single-use laryngoscopes is estimated to range from 1.5-fold (based on solid waste alone) up to 66-fold greater than traditional reusable laryngoscopes, although the use of water and chemicals for reprocessing must also be considered. Discussion: While single-use laryngoscopes have benefits of added convenience, cost effectiveness, and ease of use, they have a significantly greater environmental impact than resusable laryngoscopes. Otolaryngologists should consider the environmental impact of single-use laryngoscopes with goals of improving carbon footprint reduction.",

    abstract: "In the United Kingdom, healthcare products and services contribute 62 % of the National Health Service's greenhouse gas emissions. One proposal to reduce this impact is by replacing single-use devices (SUDs) with reusable devices. This study employs life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of a reusable anaesthetic mask made primarily of Polychloroprene and Polyisoprene; and two single-use masks one made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and one of thermoplastic elastomer and polypropylene (TPE + PP). The reusable mask is shown to be cheaper and have lower environmental impact compared to the PVC single-use mask for nine of the 11 impact categories, including GWP, but has lower environmental impact than the TPE + PP single-use mask for only three categories (HTP, MAETP, and FAETP). The major contributor of the reusable mask's impact is the reprocessing stage, which represents over 70 % of all impact categories. The LCC showed PVC single mask to have the greatest cost (£5.89) compared to TPE + PP mask (£4.99) and the reusable mask (£4.44). Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that the number of reprocessing cycles greatly influences the sustainability of the reusable mask when the number of reuses was less than 14 and that the energy consumption of the reprocessing machinery had a noticeable influence on the reusable mask's overall environmental impact. In conclusion, to make reusable masks a favourable option, manufacturers and health providers need to optimise the energy and packaging used in the reprocessing stage, together with ensuring that reusing practices i.e. minimum of cycles, are identified and communicated.",

    abstract: "Introduction: The environmental impact of endoscopy is a topic of growing interest. This study aimed to compare the carbon footprint of performing an esogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with a reusable (RU) or with a single-use (SU) disposable gastroscope. Methods: SU (Ambu aScope Gastro) and RU gastroscopes (Olympus, H190) were evaluated using life cycle assessment methodology (ISO 14040) including the manufacture, distribution, usage, reprocessing and disposal of the endoscope. Data were obtained from Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France) from April 2023 to February 2024. Primary outcome was the carbon footprint (measured in Kg CO2 equivalent) for both gastroscopes per examination. Secondary outcomes included other environmental impacts. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of varying scenarios. Results: Carbon footprint of SU and RU gastroscopes were 10.9 kg CO2 eq and 4.7 kg CO2 eq, respectively. The difference in carbon footprint equals one conventional car drive of 28 km or 6 days of CO2 emission of an average European household. Based on environmentally-extended input-output life cycle assessment, the estimated per-use carbon footprint of the endoscope stack and washer was 0.18 kg CO2 eq in SU strategy versus 0.56 kg CO2 eq in RU strategy. According to secondary outcomes, fossil eq depletion was 130 MJ (SU) and 60.9 MJ (RU) and water depletion for 6.2 m3 (SU) and 9.5 m3 (RU), respectively. Conclusion: For one examination, SU gastroscope have a 2.5 times higher carbon footprint than RU ones. These data will help with the logistics and planning of an endoscopic service in relation to other economic and environmental factors.",

    abstract: "Background: Theatre activity is a major source of hospital waste, accounting for 21–30% of total output, and is 3–6 times more energy-intensive than any other hospital department. Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure worldwide, but to date has received little analysis in this field. The aim of this study was to evaluate the carbon impact of streamlining single-use packs, and transitioning from single-use items, to reusable equivalents in cataract surgery. Methods: A focus group and prospective audit was carried out to identify single-use pack items for streamlining. A bottom-up, process-based carbon footprint analysis was conducted of single-use items and reusable alternatives using activity data provided by the suppliers and greenhouse gas (GHG) conversion factors from the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting database. Results: Total carbon savings from streamlining was 935 kgCO2e/year, and switching, was 309 kgCO2e/year. Single-use items had a 27 times greater carbon footprint than reusable equivalents (322 kgCO2 vs. 12 kgCO2e respectively). A net carbon saving was achieved from 19 or more re-uses of the reusable items compared to single-use equivalents. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of carbon emissions savings both from streamlining disposable instruments in cataract surgical packs, and from switching from single-use to reusable instruments. Mitigation strategies targeting hotspots in resource intensive areas will be an important aspect of reducing the climate burden of surgery. Change in practice and policy is required in all surgical specialities to realize net zero carbon healthcare.",

    abstract: "The gastroenterology societies are committed to reducing the carbon footprint of endoscopies and, hence, reexamining waste-generating practices. One such practice is the recommendation to use sterile water during endoscopy for endoscopy lens cleaning and colon irrigation. We critically reviewed all published medical literature and guidelines on the safety of the type of water used in endoscopy. We calculated the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of a one-liter sterile water bottle and compared it to published studies on bottled drinking water. Guidelines recommending sterile water during endoscopy are based on limited evidence and mostly expert opinions. Referenced studies utilize care protocols that are not practiced. There is also considerable cross-referencing of review articles and guidelines. Two clinical studies directly comparing tap and sterile water in gastrointestinal endoscopy found tap water to be a safe and practical cost-saving alternative to sterile water. The calculated carbon footprint of bottled sterile water is 575 grams CO2 equivalent. No direct evidence supports the recommendation and widespread use of sterile water during gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. It contributes to healthcare waste and climate change and is costly. We recommend tap water be used to fill sterile water bottles until evidence shows the need for alternative practice. It would be prudent to re-evaluate guidelines and write new ones that consider harm to the environment and society in the provision of care to patients, especially when the intervention may be more harmful than the risk it aims to address.",

    abstract: "The healthcare sector is a major consumer of energy and consumables. This is particularly striking in crisis situations, such as COVID 19, which required the massive deployment of testing and vaccination measures, which have a deleterious effect on the environment. In this paper, we assess the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of COVID19 community testing (aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus) using different diagnostic methods and scenarios. A climate-focused Life Cycle Assessment was conducted to assess the Global Warming Potential of self-testing at home and health worker-performed antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), as well as laboratory-based PCR tests. The GWP100 indicator and DALYS were used to compare their respective greenhouse gas emissions and expected health impact. Several scenarios were considered, varying the type of test, transport conditions, and pandemic phase. The expected direct emissions GWP of the tests for the same usage scenario is 0.12, 0.23, 0.69 and 0.73 kg CO2 eq per self-testing RDT, health worker-performed RDT, multiple wells PCR and single PCR respectively. The differences are mainly due to consumables (e.g., protective equipment) and local transport rather than the test itself. The emissions generated by the detection of a true positive is estimated at 1 kg CO2 eq in the high transmission phase of the pandemic, but at 100 and 2.000 kg CO2 eq for RDT and PCR respectively in the low transmission phase. When considering the GWP of COVID tests, RDTs are a better option than PCR in all scenarios. For community testing, this is all the more true as there is no clear health benefit either of using PCR rather than RDT. Our results also highlight the disproportionate impact of systematic testing during low transmission phases, due to the very high number of tests needed to detect true contagious cases. It is time to consider not only efficiency but also environmental criteria when designing public health interventions.",

    abstract: "Climate change poses a significant global health challenge, with medical procedures contributing substantially to CO2 emissions. Urology, as part of the broader healthcare sector, has begun integrating Planetary Health concepts to address this issue. While earlier studies have focused on Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of urological procedures, these evaluations remain data-dependent, and insights into intra-hospital emissions are limited. This study introduces a methodical approach for analyzing intra-institutional processes of LCA for single-use and reusable flexible ureterorenoscopes (fURS). The LCA method was applied to assess the greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents, CO2-eq) generated across the life cycle of fURS, including production, use-phase, reprocessing, maintenance, and disposal. The study approximated the Global Warming Potential (GWP) per one-hour use and evaluated associated health impacts using the ReCiPe2016(H) method, which measures Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Results showed that for reusable fURS, assuming 133 usages per device and maintenance after every 11th use, each application generated 1.24 kg CO2-eq, equivalent to 1.15E-06 DALYs. In contrast, single-use fURS generated 4.93 kg CO2-eq and 4.57E-06 DALYs per application. The production and reprocessing stages were identified as having the greatest environmental and health impacts. For reusable fURS, electricity required during refurbishment and use phases was a key contributor, whereas the production phase accounted for most of the impact in single-use devices. Overall, singleuse fURS had a substantially higher potential environmental and health impact than their reusable counterparts. This study underscores the environmental and health impacts of ureterorenoscopy and highlights the importance of incorporating Planetary Health principles into healthcare practices. It provides a foundation for further analyses and research, aiming to drive transformative action in the healthcare sector toward sustainability.",

    abstract: "Background: Healthcare represents 3–8% of a country's carbon footprint, and medicines are estimated to represent 20–55% of healthcare's carbon footprint. Unfortunately, only scarce and partial medicine life cycle assessments (LCAs) are reported due to the limited availability of needed data to perform them. Methods: We describe a method to estimate the cradle-to-pharmacy gate LCA of all oral medicines from the French pharmacopeia (n = 12,316 medicines) that includes the entire medicine-related carbon footprint, encompassing active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), excipients and packaging production, transport, medicine manufacturing, and associated corporate emissions using a hybrid LCA/environmentally extended input-output model. The uncertainty surrounding this estimation is modeled using bootstrap. Findings: Although the API carbon footprint is correlated with synthesis yield, its number of steps, presence of chiral center(s), and process mass intensity, the API carbon footprint is better predicted by its wholesale cost. Corporate emissions (34.5%), API production (28.5%), and medicine manufacturing (25.5%) are the most impactful contributors to medicine carbon footprints, while medicine packaging (5.3%), transport (3.6%), and excipients (2.7%) are less significant. Variations from one medicine to another are substantial. The mean carbon footprint of a medicine box is 8.47 kgCO2eq/box (median 1.46 kgCO2eq, 95% CI 0.34–73.98). Medicines' carbon footprint is correlated with their price but not linearly, as low-cost medicines have significantly higher emission factors of 0.2–0.3 kgCO2/€ versus 0.05–0.1 kgCO2/€ for high-cost drugs. Orphan and innovative medicines tend to have higher carbon footprints. Interpretation: Medicine carbon footprints are highly variable. This database allows for a better understanding of the carbon footprint associated with medicines, in order to better eco-design care pathways.",

    abstract: "Background: Single-use anaesthetic drug trays are used widely in Australia, but their environmental impact is unclear. Methods: A life cycle assessment was completed for 10 different types of single-use anaesthetic drug trays made of four materials: the synthetic plastics polypropylene and polystyrene, and the natural fibres bagasse (sugarcane pulp) and cellulose pulp. Results: Carbon emissions per tray from total life cycle with landfill disposal were 33–454 g CO2-eq, which equates to 152–2066 tonnes CO2-eq annually. Recycling mitigates this impact, reducing emissions per tray to 16–294 g CO2-eq. The tray with the least emissions for landfill and recycling was the small polystyrene injection tray. There was a significant linear relationship between the mass of a tray and its carbon emissions. For landfill, recycling, and incineration disposal, Pearson's r value was 0.98, 0.99, and 0.95, respectively. Composting natural fibres can give a carbon benefit over some synthetic plastics under specific disposal scenarios, but this benefit was not seen under all circumstances. There was a strong positive correlation between the increasing mass of a tray and its increasing environmental impacts for water consumption, particulate matter formation, and mineral depletion. Conclusions: Single-use trays with the lowest mass should be preferentially chosen. Recycling and composting will reduce environmental impacts. Natural fibre does not automatically confer any environmental benefit over plastic and sustainability claims should be carefully examined for accuracy. The practice of using a single-use drug tray for every procedure should be reconsidered.",

    abstract: "Introduction: As hospitals strive to reduce their environmental footprint, there is an ongoing debate over the environmental implications of reusable versus disposable linens in operating rooms (ORs). This research aimed to compare the environmental impact of reusable versus single-use OR bed covers and lift sheets using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Methods: LCA is an established tool with rigorous methodology that uses science-based processes to measure environmental impact. This study compared the impacts of three independent system scenarios at a single large academic hospital: reusable bed covers with 50 laundry cycles and subsequent landfill disposal (System 1), single-use bed covers with waste landfill disposal (System 2), and single-use bed covers with waste disposal using incineration (System 3). Results: The total carbon footprint of System 1 for 50 uses was 19.83 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq). System 2 generated 64.99 kg CO2-eq. For System 3, the total carbon footprint was 108.98 kg CO2-eq. The raw material extraction for all the material to produce an equivalent 50 single-use OR bed cover kits was tenfold more carbon-intensive than the reusable bed cover. Laundering one reusable OR bed cover 50 times was more carbon intensive (12.12 kg CO2-eq) than landfill disposal of 50 single-use OR bed covers (2.52 kg CO2-eq). Discussion: Our analysis demonstrates that one reusable fabric-based OR bed cover laundered 50 times, despite the carbon and water-intensive laundering process, exhibits a markedly lower carbon footprint than its single-use counterparts. The net difference is 45.16 kg CO2-eq, equivalent to driving 115 miles in an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. This stark contrast underscores the efficacy of adopting reusable solutions to mitigate environmental impact within healthcare facilities.",

    abstract: "Introduction: Surgical cap attire plays an important role in creating a safe and sterile environment in procedural suites, thus the choice of reusable versus disposable caps has become an issue of much debate. Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods: ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results: Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions: Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures.",

    abstract: "Facemasks have been extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this study aims to find out the environmental impacts of three types of prevalent facemasks in Tehran to select a suitable option for future epidemics. The environmental impacts of facemasks were investigated from cradle to grave in complete incineration and landfill scenarios using the ReCiPe (H) 2016 method. The environmental burden results at endpoint levels were predicted using machine learning algorithms. The results showed that 3-layer surgical masks, 3-dimensional (3D) masks, and washable masks were predominant in Tehran, accounting for 80.1% coverage. The life cycle assessment results showed that the stage of use and raw material consumption had the most destructive environmental impacts in two scenarios for total used facemasks. The most detrimental stages for 3-layer surgical, 3D, and washable facemasks were raw material consumption, packaging, and use, respectively. The contribution of use, raw material, packaging, end-of-life, production, and transportation stages in the incineration scenario was 41.54%, 31.69%, 12.45%, 7.45%, 6.33%, and 0.50%, respectively, while in the landfill scenario, it was 45.40%, 34.64%, 13.61%, -1.17%, 6.91%, and 0.60%, respectively. The comparison of the weighted values of the damage categories in the two scenarios was as follows: 3D masks > washable masks > 3-layer surgical masks. More than 85% of the damage was caused to human health. The ML results showed that artificial neural networks, gradient-boosting regression trees, and AdaBoost algorithms were able to predict the environmental impacts of used facemasks with high R2 and low error values. Based on the present findings, it is recommended to use the 3-layer surgical mask for future epidemics due to its lower environmental impacts. Therefore, if a different type of facemask is used in the future, it is necessary to reassess its environmental impacts in comparison to the recommended 3-layer surgical mask.",

The Covidien LF2019 precision scissors represent a critical tool in vascular surgery, yet their environmental impact remains unquantified. This study presents the first comprehensive life cycle assessment of precision surgical scissors, examining the environmental implications of their entire lifecycle from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal. Methods: A cradle-to-grave LCA was conducted following ISO 14040/14044 standards, analyzing the environmental impacts of the Covidien LF2019 scissors across all lifecycle stages including raw material procurement, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use phase (including sterilization cycles), and disposal. Results: The study reveals that manufacturing accounts for 42% of total environmental impact, primarily due to precision machining of surgical-grade stainless steel and titanium components. The use phase contributes 28% through repeated sterilization cycles, while raw material extraction represents 18% of total impact. Transportation and end-of-life disposal contribute 7% and 5% respectively. Conclusion: This LCA provides crucial baseline data for sustainable surgical instrument procurement and identifies key opportunities for environmental impact reduction in surgical practice.",
